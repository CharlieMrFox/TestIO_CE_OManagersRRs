Unfortunately, your bug report must be rejected because the bug report needs to describe the issue adequately.\n\nHere is the list of rejection reasons triggers: #t (title) \n\n #u (URL) \n\n #s1 (step 1) \n\n #st (other steps)\n\n #a (actual result)\n\n #e (expected result)\n\n #att (attachments)\n\n \n\n Thank you, and remember all this information for the following submission. Good luck!','t':'The title does not answer the three questions a report title must respond to about the bug: ❝Where❞, ❝what❞, and ❝when❞ it is happening.\n\nOn the other hand, the title must provide a clear overview of the problem so readers don’t have to read the whole report to understand the problem, this is why the title must describe what is happening, not what is not, avoiding generic, meaningless descriptions such as something ❝doesn’t work❞, ❝doesn’t trigger❞, etc.\n\n Note that if the bug happens under specific conditions (e.g. on a specific product detail page) or the system triggers a particular error message, this information must be part of the title\n\nFor further clarification, please refer to our article [❝Bug Report Requirements❞](https://academy.test.io/en/articles/2541949-bug-report-requirements#h_f4796ee256){HERE YOU MUST ADD YOUR FEEDBACK RELATED TO THIS SPECIFIC TICKET}','u':'The report’s URL is incorrect since it does not correspond to the one shown on the page the bug is shown.

Everything must be stated, like the buttons pressed, the exact characteristics of a product or any input entered, etc. The last step must be the one that triggers or leads to the bug. Therefore, avoid mentioning results in this section.\n\n For further clarification, please refer to our article [❝Bug Report Requirements❞](https://academy.test.io/en/articles/2541949-bug-report-requirements#h_bfb6d95941)”.\n\n{HERE YOU MUST ADD YOUR FEEDBACK RELATED TO THIS SPECIFIC TICKET}','a':'The actual result must start describing the bug after the last described step.
